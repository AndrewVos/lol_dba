h1. Rails Indexes

Rails indexes is a small package of 2 rake tasks that scan your application models and displays a list of columns that _probably_ should be indexed.

note: there should be mode fields depending on your application design and custom queries.

h2. Installation

Add *rails_indexes* to your Gemfile.
<pre>gem 'rails_indexes', :git => 'https://github.com/warpc/rails_indexes'</pre>

h2. Usage

Display a migration for adding/removing all necessary indexes based on associations:
<pre>rake db:index_migration</pre>

Display a migration for adding/removing all necessary indexes based on AR::Base#find calls (including: find, find_by, find_all_by, find_by_x_and_y, find_all_by_x_and_y):
<pre>rake db:find_query_indexes</pre>
*Notice:* At now moment it does not support Arel(the new Rails 3 Active Record Query Interface) calls (including: where, joins, includes, from, select...)

Note that add index in big database may take a long time.

h2. Tests

<pre>bundle install</pre>
<pre>rake</pre>
to run the tests
*Notice:* At now moment tests not working in Ruby 1.9, use 1.8.7.
